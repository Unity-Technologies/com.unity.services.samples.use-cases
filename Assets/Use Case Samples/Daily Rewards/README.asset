      experience the rewards starting on the first day of the month. However, to
      permit testing, we save this value to Cloud Save so each user can experience
      the Daily Rewards calendar as if the month starts when the Use Case sample

      you, as a developer, can add the Addressables address to the Currency icon
      for each Currency directly in the Custom Data on the Economy Dashboard and
      retrieve it at runtime without need to change your code. This permits, for
      example, swapping in holiday-themed Sprites simply by changing the address
      used on the Economy Dashboard without needing to update your app. '

      claiming a Daily Reward), the Currency''s key (for example, "COIN") is used
