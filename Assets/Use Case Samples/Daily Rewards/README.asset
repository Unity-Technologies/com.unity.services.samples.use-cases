    body: The Daily Reward (Monthly) Calendar is a prevalent feature in connected
      games. Whether it is presented in a weekly or monthly calendar, with or without
      completion streaks, Daily Rewards are present in games across all genre to
      boost retention.

    body: 'This feature will present a calendar of Daily Rewards that generally increase
      in value over time to encourage players to return daily to claim them. Our
      implementation permits skipping days, but rewards are always claimed sequentially
      so, if a day is missed, the same reward will be available the next day. Only
      once a particular day is claimed will the subsequent day''s reward be unlocked
      (on the next day). '

      for Daily Rewards is to set the start epoch time on Remote Config so all players
      experience the rewards starting on the first day of the month. However, to
      permit testing, we save this value to Cloud Save so each user can experience
      the Daily Rewards calendar as if the month starts when the Use Case sample
      is first opened. '

      icon Sprites for all Currencies. A key feature of this implementation is that
      you, as a developer, can add the Addressables address to the Currency icon
      for each Currency directly in the Custom Data on the Economy Dashboard and
      retrieve it at runtime without need to change your code. This permits, for
      example, swapping in holiday-themed Sprites simply by changing the address
      used on the Economy Dashboard without needing to update your app. '

      when Sprites are needed (for example, when showing the rewards granted for
      claiming a Daily Reward), the Currency''s key (for example, "COIN") is used
      as a dictionary key to quickly find the associated Sprite, which is then used
