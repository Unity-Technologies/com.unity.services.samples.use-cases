    subHeader3:
    body: A seasonal points-based reward system is a popular and effective way to
      retain players in a game over time. Unlike a time-based reward system, there
      is an element of skill required to progress through the reward track. The Battle
      Pass adds another layer of exclusive appeal to this system, while also adding
      a monetization mechanic, by letting players purchase a second premium track
      with additional rewards. This sample uses currencies as premium rewards, though
      most games are designed to award cosmetic items at the premium level, or other
      items that do not give players a gameplay advantage.

    body: This sample expands on the Seasonal Events sample to add a seasonal points-based
      reward system and Battle Pass. It's a good idea to check out that sample first,
      if you haven't already. The README in that sample explains how the seasonal
      events are configured and how they work. This document will explain how this
      Battle Pass sample builds on and complements the Seasonal Events sample, and
      specific Battle Pass features.

      the Battle Pass (premium) track. All players are eligible to claim the normal
      rewards track, but only Battle Pass holders are eligible for the Battle Pass

      that''s currently active. Reward tiers are stored as two JSON values in Remote
      Config: one array for the free tiers, and one array for the premium tiers.
      From our Cloud Code call, we also get a number of seconds until the season
      is over. With that we can control our countdown view, and eventually determine
      that it''s time to query the server again for the next season''s configs.'
