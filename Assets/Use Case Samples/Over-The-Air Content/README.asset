    body: When you want to add new content to your game, releasing a new version
      of your application that users must then install before they can play can result
      in a poor user experience. As an alternative, you can use an Over the Air Content
      approach, so that the player can open the application and begin interacting
      with the game while new content downloads in the background or during idle
      times.
