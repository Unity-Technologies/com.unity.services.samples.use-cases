# In-Game Mailbox

In-game mailboxes are common mechanisms for game developers to communicate with their players.
You can use them to tell players about new in-game events, gift players items and currency, or to help retain players in the game.

![In Game Mailbox scene](Documentation~/In_Game_Mailbox_scene.png)

## Overview

When a player loads the scene for the first time, they see an inbox with a list of messages waiting for them to read.
On subsequent loads, the inbox is either in the state they left it, or an updated state due to messages expiring between sessions.

Players can interact with the messages, claim their attachments, delete messages, or reset the inbox to a brand new state.

To see this use case in action:

1. In the Unity Editor **Project** window, select **Assets** > **Use Case Samples** > **In-Game Mailbox**, and then double-click `InGameMailboxSample.unity` to open the sample scene.
2. Enter **Play Mode** to interact with the use case.

### Initialization

When the scene loads, the `InGameMailboxSceneManager` script performs the following initialization steps:

1. Initializes Unity Gaming Services.
2. Signs in the player [anonymously](https://docs.unity.com/authentication/UsingAnonSignIn.html) using the Authentication service. If you’ve previously initialized any of the other sample scenes, Authentication will use your cached Player ID instead of creating a new one.
3. Refreshes the Economy configuration data. If new Economy items were created since the last time the player opened the app, this will initialize those items in the player's configuration.
4. Retrieves and updates currency balances from the Economy service for that authenticated user.
5. Uses the sprite addresses stored in the Economy item configuration's custom data to load all possible currency and inventory item sprites from Addressables.
6. Retrieves the updated message info for the player's inbox:
   1. Downloads the list of all possible messages from Remote Config.
   2. Retrieves the player's current inbox data from Cloud Save.
   3. Checks whether any of the messages already saved in the player's inbox are expired, and deletes them if so.
   4. Checks for any new messages that were downloaded from Remote Config and not yet added to the player's inbox.
   5. Saves the updated inbox state for the player in Cloud Save.
7. Displays the updated list of inbox messages in the scene.

### Functionality

The left panel in the scene displays the list of messages in the player's inbox.
This list updates over time as messages expire, or based on player interaction.

Below the list, a counter displays how many messages are in the inbox and the max number of messages that can be in the inbox at any given time.
When a player loads the scene for the first time, the inbox is full.

When all messages have been deleted from the inbox (either through player interaction or message expiration), a popup appears prompting the player to [reset the inbox](#reset-the-inbox-for-a-specific-audience).

**Note**: This popup is a usability feature of the sample, and would not be an expected interaction in a real-world implementation.

#### Open a message

When you select a message from the list, the following occurs:

1. The full details of the message appears on the right side of the scene.
2. The message is marked as read, and that status is saved to Cloud Save.

If the message has an attachment, there is also an indication of which Economy items are attached, along with a button to claim them.

##### Claim an attachment

When you press the **Claim** button, the client code calls the `InGameMailbox_ClaimAttachment.js` Cloud Code script with the selected message's ID included as a parameter. The following occurs on the backend:

1. The client requests the Cloud Save inbox data, and locates the message with the supplied ID.
2. The script checks whether the message has an unclaimed attachment.
3. Assuming the message does have an unclaimed attachment, the script makes an Economy `makeVirtualPurchase` call using the Virtual Purchase ID from the `message.messageInfo.attachment` field.
4. If the purchase processes successfully, the `message.metadata.hasUnclaimedAttachment` field is set to `false` and saved in Cloud Save, so that the player cannot claim the attachment again.

#### Delete a message

When you press the delete button for a message:

1. The message is removed from the local list of inbox messages.
2. If the inbox was previously full, such that deleting the message created space for a new message, the client rechecks the list of all possible messages downloaded from Remote Config against the message ID of the last message saved in Cloud Save to see if there are any new messages to add to the inbox. If there are, it adds as many of those messages to the inbox as will fit.
3. The updated list of inbox messages is then saved in Cloud Save.
4. Finally, the view refreshes to show the updated list. If the deleted message was previously selected, this also updates the UI to not display the deleted message's detail view.

#### Claim all attachments

When you press the **Claim All** button, the client code makes a call to the `InGameMailbox_ClaimAllAttachments.js` Cloud Code script. The following occurs on the backend:

1. The client requests inbox data from Cloud Save.
2. Cloud Save returns a list of inbox messages filtered to only show messages with `message.metadata.hasUnclaimedAttachment` set to `true`.
3. For each message in this filtered list:
   1. The script makes an Economy `makeVirtualPurchase` call using the Virtual Purchase ID from the `message.messageInfo.attachment` field.
   2. If the purchase processes successfully, `message.metadata.hasUnclaimedAttachment` is set to `false`, and `message.metadata.isRead` is set to `true`.
4. Once all message attachments are claimed, the updated message list is saved in Cloud Save.

**Note**: Saving changes in Cloud Save after each attachment is claimed would make the process more fault tolerant. However, it would also require more server calls and therefore be less efficient than the selected approach. It is up to the developer which advantage to prioritize.

#### Delete all read and claimed attachments

When you press the **Delete Read** button:

1. The script loops through the list of inbox messages, and removes each message that has both `message.metadata.isRead` set to `true` and `message.metadata.hasUnclaimedAttachment` set to `false`. This implementation does not delete messages with unclaimed attachments, to prevent players from accidentally deleting messages with available attachments.
2. If the inbox was previously full, such that deleting the message created space for a new message, the client rechecks the list of all possible messages downloaded from Remote Config against the message ID of the last message saved in Cloud Save to see if there are any new messages to add to the inbox. If there are, it adds as many of those messages to the inbox as will fit.
3. The updated list of inbox messages is then saved in Cloud Save.
4. Finally, the view refreshes to show the updated list. If the deleted message was previously selected, this also updates the UI to not display the deleted message's detail view.

#### Reset the inbox for a specific audience

At the bottom of the scene, you can reset the inbox while impersonating a particular audience:

- `Default`
- `All Spenders`
- `Unengaged Players`
- `French Speakers`
- `New Players`

Each of the non-default audiences adds a message to the message list that is specific to that particular audience. These messages are determined by Game Overrides.

When you reset the inbox for the given audience, the following occurs:

1. The scene resets, clearing the selected message field and deleting the Cloud Save inbox data.
2. The client queries Remote Config with the specified audience, to retrieve the list of potential messages that includes any audience specific ones that were previously omitted.
3. The maximum number of messages are added to the inbox from the Remote Config data, and saved in Cloud Save.
4. The view refreshes to show the new list of messages.

#### Open the inventory

When you press the inventory bag icon, the following occurs:

1. The client calls `EconomyService.Instance.PlayerInventory.GetInventoryAsync()` to refresh the player's list of owned Economy inventory items.
2. A pop-up window displays the resulting list of inventory items.

\* Note that though it is listed as a package and requires separate dashboard configuration, Game Overrides doesn't actually have an SDK to install from Package Manager. It is a server side offering that affects values returned from other services, like Remote Config.

To use these services in your game, activate each service for your Organization and project in the [Unity Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.unity3d.com/).

### Unity Cloud services configuration

To replicate this sample scene's setup in your own Unity project, configure the following items:

- Cloud Code scripts
- Economy items
- Remote Config values
- Remote Config Game Overrides

To configure these items you can [use the Deployment package](#using-the-deployment-package), or [manually enter them using the Unity Cloud Dashboard](#using-the-unity-cloud-dashboard).
The recommended best practice is to use the Deployment package as it greatly accelerates this process.

#### Using the Deployment package

To deploy configurations using the Deployment package:

1. Open the [Deployment window](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.services.deployment@1.2/manual/deployment_window.html).
1. Check in `Common` and `In-Game Mailbox`.
1. Click `Deploy Selection`.

This deploys the following items:

- Cloud Code scripts
- Economy items
- Remote Config values
- Remote Config Game Overrides

#### Using the Unity Cloud Dashboard

You can use the [Unity Cloud Dashboard](dashboard.unity3d.com) to manually configure your services by project and environment.
Refer to the following sections to configure this sample.

##### Game Overrides

Configure the following [Overrides](https://docs.unity.com/gameoverrides/CreateAnOverride.html) in the Unity Cloud Dashboard:

| **Details**    | Name the Override “Messages All Spenders Overrides”.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Note**: This sample determines which Game Override data should be returned based on a JEXL match with the audience value specified in the client. This is so that the use case can fake a player being in different audiences on demand. In a real app, the Game Overrides would likely be set up to use built-in or custom-defined Analytics audiences for targeting (i.e. during Game Override's targeting step, choose `Stateful (Audiences)` and check the appropriate analytics audience from the list or click `Build a new Audience`).
