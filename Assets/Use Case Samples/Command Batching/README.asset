    body: Command batching is the concept where each game action is a Command which
      can be collected into a queue to be sent to the server in batches for processing.
      Using Command batching can optimize the bandwidth your game uses to be as energy
      efficient as possible or to prevent your game from running slowly because of
      frequent server calls or server bottlenecks (rate limiting). This optimization
      provides users with a more pleasant game experience with less wait times by
      reducing the number and/or frequency of server calls made by your game.

    body: This sample demonstrates a game where the player has a specified number
      of turns, and Commands are created and saved for each move the player makes
      on a turn. At the end of the game, all Commands that were created are then
      processed by the server as a group.

      Imagine a game that distributes rewards on the server after every Command,
      in particular rewarding a player XP by calling Cloud Save and Coins by calling
      Economy. For example:'

    body: 'These three Commands would then result in a minimum of six calls to various
      Unity Services (in this case Cloud Save and Economy). You can see how in a
      full game this could end up with a lot of server calls being made while the
      game is being played, potentially slowing the game. However, if all three of
      these Commands are stored in a batch and processed at one time (described in
      greater detail in the Implementation Overview section below), it would result
      in just two Unity Services calls: one to Cloud Save to increase XP by 250,
      and one to Economy to add 45 Coins.'

    subHeader2: 
    subHeader3: 
    body: This use case is structured such that a single "game" involves making a
      specified number of turns, where a single turn is completed by clicking on
      one of four buttons. Each button generates a different Command, with different
      corresponding rewards. The Command is processed by being added to a batch queue
      (for future server processing) as well as by distributing its rewards locally.
      This local reward distribution allows players to immediately see the results
      of the turn, but is not considered truly authoritative; you'll see momentarily
      that any local distributions will get overwritten by the server after it validates
      and processes the Commands. Once the player has completed all their turns,
      the game is over and the queue of Commands are sent to Cloud Code as a single
      json blob.

    subHeader2: 
    subHeader3: 
    body: "The first step of the Cloud Code script is to unpack the json blob into
      a list of Commands again. The next step is to verify that the batch contains
      exactly the number of Commands expected (in this example the batch is always
      the same number of Commands, however that does not have to be a requirement),
      and that the Commands are in an order that is legal game play (for example
      the Achieve Bonus Goal Command cannot be triggered until the Open Chest Command
      has occurred). If anything about the batch of Commands is deemed invalid, the
      script will return a failure and the Commands' rewards will not be distributed
      on the server. However if the batch is valid, the Cloud Code script will proceed
      to the next step. This step is to determine what rewards should be distributed
      as a result of the Commands (for example, Command = \u201Cenemy defeated\u201D;
      reward = \u201Cadd 10 XP\u201D). This information is received from Remote Config.
      Storing the Command and Reward mapping on Remote Config allows for rewards
      to be tuned remotely in a single place, while still changing the distributions
      done locally by the client, as well as remotely by the server. The rewards
      for all the Commands in the batch are grouped by type (for example, all Commands
      may increase XP, these XP increases would be added up so that a single server
      call updates the XP by the total amount). Finally, the Cloud Code script will
      make all the necessary calls to the Unity Services APIs (in this case, Economy
      and Cloud Save) to distribute the rewards. Once distribution is complete, the
      script returns, indicating the successful action to the client."

    subHeader3: 
    body: Whenever the Cloud Code script returns (either on success or failure) the
      client code calls the Unity Services to get their latest data. If the batch
      was processed successfully by the server, this should result in no visible
      change to the player's wallet or other stats (because from their perspective
      the rewards were distributed immediately during game play). However, if the
      batch was invalid and the Cloud Code script failed to process the batch, the
      client will update the player's wallet and other stats back to where they were
      at before the game was played, overwriting the local state.

    subHeader3: 
    body: This creates a bit of a mixed-authoritative game. During certain periods
      of time the game relies on the local authority to know what the player's wallet
      and stats are. However, the server ultimately has the final authority on the
      player's state. While this mixed-authority is not appropriate for all game
      styles, it can be very useful for the game styles that can use it, such as
      turn-based, single-player, infinite runner, and puzzle games. Additionally,
      Command batching can be a good starting point when developing a solution for
      offline support or bad connection tolerance in games that choose to provide
      such features.
