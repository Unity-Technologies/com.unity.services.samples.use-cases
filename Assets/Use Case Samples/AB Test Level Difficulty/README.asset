      the screen displays their level, as well as an XP meter that indicates their
      current XP and the total amount of XP required to level up (either 100, 80,
      60, 50, or 30). The amount of XP that a player needs to level up depends on
      which test group they were randomly placed into.  '

      is signed in to an anonymous player ID (either one that has already been created
      from a previous sign-in or a new one) using the Authentication service. Once
      Authentication has completed sign-in, the client code gets the player''s current
      data from Cloud Save. If it is a new user (i.e. not a cached anonymous player),
      the player''s initial level (1) and xp (0) will be saved in Cloud Save instead
      of loading existing data. The client code will also download any existing currency
      data from the Economy service. Finally, Remote Config will be queried to fetch
      the appropriate A/B test group name and xp needed for leveling up for this
      player. All of this updated data will get displayed in the scene. At this point,
      the "Gain XP" button is enabled for interaction.  '

      the player''s info from Cloud Code and Remote Config, increases the XP by the
      amount specified by Remote Config (10 points), and tests whether the new player
      XP total equals the amount of XP needed for leveling up. If it does not, the
      player''s new XP is saved in Cloud Code and returned to the client code, which
      updates the values and shows text indicating how much XP was added. If it does,
      Economy is called to distribute the level-up rewards (100 COIN), and Cloud
      Code is called to save the increased player level and new player XP (XP gets
      reset to 0 upon level up) before returning the info to the client code.  '

      to an Addressable address, which can be used to display the sprite (i.e. "Sprites/Currency/Coin").
      This step allows players to experience different art based on their segmentation
      and provides a convenient way to retrieve additional data for a specific currency
      at runtime.  '
