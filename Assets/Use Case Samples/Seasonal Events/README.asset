    body: Seasonal events can increase game sessions and overall interest in a game,
      as they give existing players new and fun content throughout the year to look

      is left in the current event, the currency rewards that can be won during the
      event, and a "Play Challenge" button that, when clicked, opens a popup where

    body: When this scene first loads, it will initialize Unity Services and sign
      the player in anonymously using Authentication. This can be seen in the SeasonalEventsSceneManager
      script. Once Unity Services completes initialization, we call the GetServerTime
      function via Cloud Code so we can base Game Override and Remote Config data
      off the server time. Then, Remote Config is queried to get the current values
      for the event-related keys. These values allow for displaying the active event
      name, the potential rewards for completing the event challenge, and the themed
      background image and play buttons.

      time. This is a simplification to be able to frequently observe the season
      change. In a real app, developers likely set up a Game Override to have specific
      start and end dates, then Remote Config determines when the Game Override is
      shown based on the server\u2019s date/time. In that case, the client and server
      implementations can be a bit different."

    body: 'When a player clicks "Play Challenge", followed by "Collect Rewards" it
      initiates a call to the Cloud Code script "Grant Event Reward". This script
      calls Remote Config to determine which rewards should be distributed (this
      has the potential to differ from what the player expects, if they''re altering
      their device clock or if they clicked claim right at the very end of an event),
      and then calls Economy to add those rewards to their currency balances. The
      challenge can only be played once per active season, so once the Cloud Code
      script distributes the rewards, it saves the current season name and timestamp
      to Cloud Save. This info is used by the client to determine whether the current
      season''s challenge has already been played, and if it has, to disable the
      "Play Challenge" button. '

      button on the bottom/right.
