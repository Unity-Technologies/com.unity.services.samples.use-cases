    body: In some games, it's desirable to play a mini game as a reward or to advance
      game play. This sample demonstrates how to use Cloud Code and other UGS packages
      to validate game play in a mini game that implements a simple artificial opponent
      against the player. Additionally, this sample demonstrates how gameplay can
      be rewarded based on game outcome by awarding bonus Coins for wins and ties.
      This can make the mini games more enjoyable and even affect game economy going
      forward.

      the AI and receive a Coin Currency reward based on the outcome: 100 Coins for
      a win, 25 for a tie. Each game begins with a random player (50% human, 50%
      AI) and progresses until a player successfully places 3 pieces in a row (win)
      or the board is full (tie). '

    - body: CloudAiMiniGame_GetState is called once at startup to return the existing
        game if possible or generate a random game if none exists. This script will
        also clear the player's Coin total to 0 at the start of the first game so
        win/tie count should reflect the current Coin quantity, unless other Use
        Case Samples are visited.

      linkList: []
    - body: CloudAiMiniGame_PlayerMove is called for each player move. The script
        is called with x,y coordinates and Cloud Code validates the player's move,
        makes an AI move if the game isn't over, determines if the game should end,
        and returns the final updated state. This script also maintains a win/loss/tie
        count and calls Economy to grant Coins for Wins and Ties.

      linkList: []
    - body: CloudAiMiniGame_StartNewGame is called when the player presses the [New
        Game] or [Forfeit] button (Forfeit replaces New Game whenever a game is in
        progress). This script checks if a game is in progress (isGameOver is false),
        and if so, the Loss Count is increased. Next, a new game is created, a random
        starting player is selected, and if AI is to go first, a piece is added at
        a random location on the board. Finally, the new game state is then returned
        to the client.

      Code will reset the quantity of the Coin Currency to zero. By removing any
      initial Coins, the quantity will be a multiple of 100 or 25 which simplifies
      reward visualization. This also serves as example of how Currencies can be
      set to specific quantities from Cloud Code. '

    body: Cloud Save keeps a json record of the full game state using the key "CLOUD_AI_GAME_STATE".
      The associated value stores sequential moves made by each player, the overall
      state, flags for game over, player turn, if this is a new game/move (so UI
      can show a popup, if appropriate), as well as a permanent counter for wins,
      losses and ties. To demonstrate the full game cycle, we've added the [Debug
      Reset Game] button which will remove the "CLOUD_AI_GAME_STATE" key from Cloud
      Save and call "CloudAiMiniGame_GetState" as it did at the start of the session.
      Since Cloud Code then believes this to be a new player, it will reset Coin
      quantity to 0, create a new save state with all counters set to 0 and generate
      a new starting game with a random starting player.
