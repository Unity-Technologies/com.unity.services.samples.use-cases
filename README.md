# Unity Gaming Services Use Cases

This Unity Gaming Services (UGS) Samples package contains a collection of samples designed to show you how you can use multiple UGS products to solve common game development challenges. These samples implement typical backend game use cases and game design elements, show how to resolve specific development tasks, and highlight the efficiency you can achieve in your game backend by integrating different UGS packages in your project.

_Note: This project is tied to a Unity Services Account that allows read-only testing in the Editor. The messages "Unable to link project to Unity Services" in Project Settings and "Unable to access Unity Services" in Build Settings are expected. Additionally, you will be unable to create a device build of this project._

_Note: This project uses the Unity Mediation package, which requires [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) to be installed if building for iOS. If your project uses the Unity Mediation package, see that package's [documentation](https://docs.unity.com/mediation) on [requirements](https://docs.unity.com/mediation/SDKIntegrationUnityRequirements.html) and [troubleshooting](https://docs.unity.com/mediation/TroubleshootingIntegrationsiOS.html), before building for iOS._

## Additional Samples

On top of this project, the following additional samples can help you implement UGS features in your games.

- [Additional sample projects](https://docs.unity.com/ugs/en-us/solutions/manual#Sample_projects)

## Using your own Unity Services Account

These samples use UGS packages which have already been configured so you can easily explore the use case samples provided.

To use these implementations in your own project, you will need to setup and configure the services used in your own UGS Dashboard. Learn more about each configuration in the README.md file within each samples directory.

## Feedback and Sample Requests

Your opinion matters to us, and we would like to hear from you so we can provide you with the best learning material thatâ€™ll help you become a Unity Gaming Services expert in no time.

You can let us know how we're doing by filling out [this anonymous, short survey](https://unitysoftware.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_eE6DomzzTS5YO6a) - it should take less than a minute to fill out!

Alternatively, you can reach us for questions, or to offer feedback or ideas for new sample use cases in the [Unity Gaming Services Forum](https://forum.unity.com/forums/unity-gaming-services-general-discussion.561/) (we even have a helpful [tag](https://forum.unity.com/tags/unity-gaming-services-samples/) to filter by!).
Also, while in Play Mode in the samples project, you can submit anonymous feedback by using the feedback button in the bottom left corner of each scene.

## Cloud Diagnostics & User Reporting

Unity's Cloud Diagnostics service helps to ensure the quality of this project by automatically sending diagnostic data to the dashboard when you encounter errors.
Additionally, the User Reporting feature lets you submit a screenshot and detailed feedback about a sample by clicking the Feedback button in any of the Sample scenes during Play Mode.

To set up Cloud Diagnostics and User Reporting in your own project, follow the set-up instructions provided in the dashboard.
[Setting up Cloud Diagnostics](https://unitytech.github.io/clouddiagnostics/userreporting/UnityCloudDiagnosticsSettingUp.html)

_Note: If you don't want to automatically send exception data, disable Cloud Diagnostics under Project Settings > Services > Cloud Diagnostics._
