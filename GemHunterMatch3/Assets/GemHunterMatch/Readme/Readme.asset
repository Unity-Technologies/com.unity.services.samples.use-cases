    heading: About this project
    text: 'This sample shows how you can create great-looking 2D dynamic lighting
      in match 3, word, and card games, in which static scenes and gameplay are common.
      The sample uses the Sprite Custom Lit Shader Graph to create custom lighting
      that illuminates the pieces in a simple but visually appealing way. This custom
      shader is combined with out-of-the-box 2D lighting features, secondary textures,
      and VFX Graph capabilities in URP.  You can add the sample content to your
      own creative projects or add your own systems, graphics, levels, or collectables
      to the sample. '

    heading: '2D lighting: Sprite Lit and Sprite Custom Lit shaders'
    text: "The default Sprite Lit shader makes it easy to enhance games with real-time
      2D lights, change the appearance of characters as they get closer to a light
      source, or move light objects affecting the environment.  Sometimes, due to
      gameplay, convenience, or art direction needs, you\u2019ll want to use a custom
      lighting model. You can achieve this with a Sprite Custom Lit Shader Graph,
      which enables you to modify the 2D Light Texture information, and/or illuminate
      the sprite in creative ways. In Gem Hunter Match, for example, a \"fictional\"
      light position is represented by a GameObject called LightRotator, which is
      animated to create a glare effect off the gems. Both modified and fully customized
      2D light information is in use in the TileShader Shader Graph applied to the
      gems in the game. "

    heading: '2D effects with Shader Graph and VFX Graph '
    text: 'In the recent past in Unity, you could create 2D effects mainly with the
      CPU-based Built-In Particle System or by baking animation into sprites. In
      Unity 2022 LTS, VFX Graph supports 2D effects, so you can now enable millions
      of particles on the GPU. And add more visual variety and nuance to your graphics
      and animation by rendering each particle with a Shader Graph shader that reacts
      to 2D lights.  For example, the ripple effect in the sample is made with a
      Shader Graph shader and the CameraSortingLayer texture enabled in the 2D Renderer
      Data Asset. All the effects can be found in the VFX folder '

    heading: Tilemap as a level design tool
    text: "Unity\u2019s Tilemap system provides visual, out-of-the box design tools
      that you can use instead of creating your own custom level design tools for
      a grid-based game. For example, the Tilemap API offers convenient ways to track
      the position of the many pieces. The level design in Gem Hunter Match was mainly
      created with a Tilemap (named Logic) in which all the tiles are swapped out
      for actual GameObjects when you press Play. "

    text: "Happy Harvest is another sample that shows you how to implement a variety
      of 2D lighting and special effects with URP and Unity 2022 LTS. This sample
      is a 2D top-down farming simulation game that uses 2D lights, shadow effects,
      skeletal animation, sprite libraries, visual effects, and more.   Finally,
      don\u2019t forget to check our other 2D lighting and effects sample, Dragon
      Crashers, recently updated with a mini-manual to help guide you through the
      sample\u2019s lighting setup. Both projects are available on the Unity Asset
      Store. "

    text: "You can use the assets in Gem Hunter Match in your own projects. Or, add
      your own content to the sample, like creating new levels. Go to File > New
      Scene to use the template. The LevelData object contains the moves and goals
      information. The Grid/Tilemap and Tilemap_Frame contain the visual background,
      while the Logic Tilemap contains the pieces\u2019 placeholders and spawners
      (the locations from where pieces will drop)."
